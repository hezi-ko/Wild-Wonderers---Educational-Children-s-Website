                    <p>This first step in the team project was obviously to form a team and to agree upon a charter for group work. Specifically, I 
                        would like to reflect on our team meetings during studio where we began to find out what our individual strengths and weaknesses 
                        as a team were. During studio we sat down as a group and got to know each other. In the beginning it was a bit awkward and team members
                        were a bit shy to share. I tried to push myself to break the ice as I believe if we could build good rapport and understanding of each 
                        other in the beginning it will help prove useful through the duration of the project. 
                        <br><br>
                        The process of getting to know each other and understanding what we brought to the table and what we struggled with strengthened 
                        our team. The reason I say this is because everyone made an effort to get to know each other and voice their individual interests. 
                        We were then able to effectively complete our team charter, set up a platform and standard for communication as well as begin 
                        sharing ideas and interests for our project direction. This initial experience allowed me to begin honing my communication skills 
                        and techniques for effective team work and project management.

                    <h2> Critical Reflective Journal – Week 6:</h2>

                    <p>
                        This week my team finalised our concept and worked towards completing our project design proposal presentation. My main task this 
                        week was to work on the interaction plan. I had practiced creating an interaction plan during my studio but during our group meeting 
                        dividing tasks it was clear that there was still confusion as to what details should actually go into the interaction plan. Initially 
                        I was apprehensive about taking on the responsibility of the interaction plan but I decided to meet it head on. 
                        <br><br>
                        In order to successfully complete the interaction plan I went back to practical material and attempted to understand the examples 
                        that were went through. This went well, however, the biggest challenge I faced when building out interaction plan was capturing and 
                        appropriate level of detail based on time restrictions. As well as formulating a plan to be able to articulate our plan effectively 
                        visually and orally during our presentation.
                        <br><br>
                        Revisiting previous practical material and examples was a great solution to the gap in knowledge about formulating an interaction plan.
                         Whilst I managed to understand and apply the examples eventually, in future my apprehension could have been addressed by seeking 
                         clarification earlier in the process of my work which may have eased some of the confusion.

                    <p>

                        Working towards our design proposal was quite an enjoyable process. The first step was understanding where the interests in our group 
                        lay. We did this by first sharing our individual design proposals with each other and running through the ideation exercises learned in 
                        the first few weeks to find areas of overlap. At this stage it was helpful for us to focus on our target users in order to provide more 
                        direction for ourselves. The sketch below shows our initial brainstorming of what we thought out application could look like. 
                        <br><br> 
                        We continued exploring a range of design computing solutions within our  problem space by having more discussions as a team, receiving 
                        feedback from the teaching team and conducting more ideation and sketches. Eventually we settled on flora and fauna as our theme and our 
                        target users as children from the ages of 5-12 years old. Below is an updated sketch of the results of our further ideation.

                        responsible for the interaction plan, however I aided with multiple parts developing our presentation. My conrtibutions included refining 
                        our idea, feedback on the use case scenario, and developing a work breakdown schedule. Our proposed work breakdown schedule can be viewed

                        Overall the experience of completing our design proposal was a valuable experience. The main takeaway and learning experience from this was 
                        building a proposal that adhered to project specifications as well as justifying and linking design specifications to user needs. Furthermore 
                        it was presented an opportunity for me to practice presenting my work in an oral fashion. This is something I have experience with and am quite 
                        comfortable with. My group mates felt quite anxious about presenting orally and it was a great experience being able to provide support in this area to my teammates.
                        <br><br>
                        Looking back, the experience of collaboratively working on this project allowed me to develop both my teamwork and design skills. I also learned
                        that breaking down our design into smaller iterations like sketching allowed us to make steady progress. This experience has shown that in future we could
                        focus on task delegation to ensure each group members strengths are leveraged. Additionally, I saw the value in helping others with their challenges.

                    <h2>Critical Reflective Journal – Week 7</h2>

                    <p>

                        This week we conducted a “paper prototyping” activity to test the interaction flow of our prototype. More specifically, our team drew out the frames of our 
                        application on white boards, formulated a testing plan and successfully tested our paper prototype and gained valuable feedback on our design. I felt very positive 
                        and happy about our progress prototyping and that we were able to run multiple rounds of testing. Our testing session went well because all team members were present 
                        and were able to take on the required roles to run the testing session effectively. I personally was responsible for facilitating the tester through the testing protocol. 
                        Other team members were helpful by recording notes and changing the state of the protocol. Because all team members were fulfilling their individual roles it meant that 
                        we could obtain more authentic and comprehensive user feedback.
                        <br><br>
                        Ultimately, the process of conducting this activity showed me the value of testing your prototype with users early in the process, regardless of the fidelity of the 
                        prototype. Additionally, I believe the activity demonstrates the benefits of having assigned roles in a team. One area for improvement in this activity could be the 
                        comprehensiveness of our testing protocol.

                        My assigned task to complete for out MVP was the sound match game. I had started development of the sound match game a bit later. I found myself tight for time because 
                        I did not account for the time it would take me to refresh my knowledge to execute the design we created. Eventually, I was able to pull animal sound data from the ALA API, 
                        and after refreshing my CSS I was able to replicate the design. My team members were especially helpful in helping me refresh my skills and fill in my gaps of knowledge. 
                        It was frustrating in the beginning struggling to fill my gaps in knowledge. In future I would seek help from my team members earlier. Additionally I wouldn’t underestimate 
                        the time it would take me to refresh my CSS knowledge.

                        interactions and success criteria. Overall I felt the presentation went well, however we did struggle to fit all our points within the allotted time. In future,

                        This week whilst working on our project our team encountered a lot of trouble trying to get additional information from the ALA API. We wanted to pull as much data 
                        as we could from APIs. However, upon trying to access more detailed information via an API call, we ran into CORS errors and authentication issues. A lot of it due to poor 
                        documentation. We spent a long time troubleshooting the issue to no avail. This was extremely frustrating spending a lot of time troubleshooting an issue with no progress. 
                        <br><br>
                        One of our team members emailed ALA about the issues we were facing. We then managed to get clarity on what we needed to perform a successful call for the information we desired. 
                        It was great action from the team to seek additional information from an external source. In this case we sought help early saving further stress and allowing development of other 
                        features of the application.

                    <h2>Overall MVP Reflection:</h2>

                    <p>

                        Working towards our MVP was a challenging and rewarding experience. Our MVP can be divided into three main sections. Developing our designs, developing the MVP and presentation preparations.
                        <br><br>
                        This first step in working towards our MVP was turning our sketches into high-fidelity designs in Figma. The first step that was extremely helpful was running more detailed prototyping sessions. 
                        I go into more detail about this in CRJ week 7. Once we had completed our paper prototyping session and gained feedback; we had a bit more direction in completing our high-fidelity prototype in 
                        Figma. All team members contributed to the design process. However, this is not my strongest point and I struggled a bit with developing the Figma design. This is where help from my team members 
                        really came in. My main contributions during this high-fidelity prototyping phase was picking a colour scheme, consolidating inspiration from existing sources to supplement the design as well as 
                        mapping interactions using Figma’s prototyping tools. Initially the team struggled to gain momentum in developing our design, but it was a priority to get it right and a take our time with it, 
                        which was frustrating at first. However, as we gained more clarity with our design things became easier. This stage was also a learning moment for me as even though I did not get into the nitty 
                        gritty of the design work, I saw how I could be valuable in other areas like consolidating inspiration, providing feedback, analysing user testing and making a functioning Figma prototype. I was 
                        initially worried that I wouldn’t be able to contribute as much in this stage.

                        After our designs were finalised in Figma and we completed a bit of user testing with the Figma prototype we were then ready to start development of our MVP. First we delegated rolls for what 
                        each member should complete. And from there the first challenge was deciding what platform we would use to develop our MVP. We eventually settled on CodeSandbox and online IDE that allows 
                        synchronous web development. This was a good solution for our group as we could develop in real-time. I was given the primary responsibility of developing the sound match game. I began by making 
                        sure I could obtain animal sounds from the Atlas of Living (ALA) API. This took me some time for two reasons, the first being poor time management and the second being the time it took me to get 
                        familiar with the ALA API. However, once I was familiar with the API I was able to make a fetch request to obtain animal sounds.

                        My next step was to replicate the design of the sound match programmatically. I struggled with CSS styling initially as it had been a while since I had done web development. This is where my team
                         was valuable in providing support in refreshing me on ways to organise components using CSS as this was a weak spot for me. I was able to replicate the design we had created in Figma as well as 
                         implement sound playing when the user clicks the speaker button. However, I was not able to start implementing the actual game functionality.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong> Finally, </strong> once our team had completed our planned development for the MVP we then began preparations for our presentation. Since I completed the interaction plan in the previous presentation I was
                         responsible for presenting how our MVP adhered to the interaction plan and where we could improve. I determined that improvements are needed in orientation, visibility, feedback, error prevention,
                          and language to align more with our interaction plan. This includes ensuring compatibility across different device sizes and orientations through testing, improving visibility by refining colour 
                          schemes, fonts and animations, as well as testing edge cases in our games to prevent errors.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, the process of working towards the MVP was both challenging and rewarding. The initial phase of turning sketches into high-fidelity designs in Figma was a key moment for the team. 
                        I personally found this stage difficult, as design is not my strongest area, but I was able to contribute in my own way. Even though I was able to make progress I was unable to fully implement
                        the game functionality by the MVP deadline. This experience showed the importance of time management and seeking help. The team helping each other through areas of struggle, was a key factor 
                        in overcoming completing the MVP. 
                        <br><br>
                        The biggest lesson from the development phase was that familiarizing myself with new tools or APIs early in the process is crucial. By addressing these issues earlier, I could have avoided some 
                        of the time management problems I faced. Additionally, refreshing skills that may not be used often, such as CSS styling, beforehand would have made the development process smoother.

                    <p>

                        This week we reviewed the feedback from our MVP presentation, categorised actionable feedback and delegated responsibilities. We were successfully able to draft an action plan based on the 
                        UX goals and user needs we had specified. I was assigned to complete the development of the sound match game. We decided as a group to simplify the design of the game to further align with 
                        our target user. We considered user needs, time constraints, and our technical capabilities. We did a good job of keeping the user experience a top priority when choosing what responsibilities to delegate.

                        In order to work towards completing our final product for the course, I was delegated to complete the implementation of the sound match game. As mentioned in the previous section the sound match
                         component was not completely implemented. However it is a feature we want fully functional in our final product as it is a key feature for our target users. 
                        <br><br>
                        After our MVP presentation our team sat down and consolidated all the feedback we received from our presentation and began to come up with an action plan of what we wanted to complete by the deadline.
                         We took into account features that would be important for our users, time constraints and technical ability. Upon review we decided on action items for the next 2 weeks which we colour coded. An
                          image of this can be seen in CRJ 11.
                        <br><br>
                        As I am writing this I am in the process of working towards the final product and as previously mentioned I am primarily in charge of completing the sound match game. Based on feedback we decided
                        to simplify the sound match game. A rough sketch of the new proposed design can be seen below. I intend to modify my code to use CSS grid to organise components as I believe this will give us a
                        more responsive design as well as make it easier to organise game components. We have opted to present one sound to the user and 3 images to reduce cognitive load as well as adhere to a simplistic
                        design which is one of our UX goals.  We also intend to apply CSS grid to the videos page as we have been struggling with the layout of this page. We believe CSS grid will help us achieve a cleaner
                        design.

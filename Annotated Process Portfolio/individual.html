                    My journey in this course started by first formulating my own idea of what my project could look like. The poster in the image above is the culmination 
                    of the individual ideation work I completed over weeks 1 to 3. In order to reach this idea I participated in various learning activities in studio sessions.
                    <br><br>
                    One activity I found particularly valuable was the group work conducted in studio week 1 that placed the foundation for my individual work. Working in groups 
                    of 5 we selected a theme and group members tried to find relevant datasets associated with the selected brief, and think of unique ideas for presentation of 
                    the data. Our team started with a general brainstorm on sticky notes and eventually were able to find four different datasets that we thought could be combined
                     in a unique way. During the first round my team chose flaura and fauna as the theme and during the second round we built off some concepts another team had already 
                     come up with. I have included images in the gallery below of the output of our work.
                    <br><br>
                    I applied the ideas and methodologies learned during the first 2 weeks to my own work. I selected flaura and fauna as my theme and envisioned creating an interactive 
                    map where users can find out more information about animal species in Australia. Overall I enjoyed the process of coming up with this idea, however one thing I really
                     struggled with was coming up with a novel feature for my application. Because my target users were primarily tourists and exchange students I though my novel feature
                      could be including aboriginal language translations.

                <p style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 20px;">

                    This peer reviewed article explores techniques and factors that technical communicators need to be aware of when 
                    designing web sites for children. The authors acknowledge that children are one of the fastest growing segments of 
                    internet users. The researchers in this paper conducted a usability test with 9 students on an educational website 
                    targeted at 7-9 year olds. The paper links the results of the usability study to themes from existing literature to come 
                    p with design guidelines. Insight is gained into factors like the page length, font size and type, colour and more. For example,
                     the researchers note the children prefer bold and vivid colours as well as enjoy sound included in the website.
                      This information is valuable to us because it informs and supports the design decisions we made. We intentionally have 
                      used bright colours as well as incorporated sound to engage and cater to our target audience. Following some of the guidelines 
                      presented in this paper can help enhance the user experience.

                <p style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 20px; word-wrap: break-word;"> 
                    This peer reviewed article, although focusing on the tourism sector, presents some useful guidelines and insights for designing
                     childrenâ€™s websites. The authors highlight the need for creating usable and accessible websites for children. Factors like 
                     structure navigation, language and gamification are discussed. Some guidelines we have adopted since the beginning of our design, 
                     for example, that language should be simple and precise relative to target age. They also acknowledged the utility of gamification
                      in engaging users to learn through a fun and engaging way. Again this source provided valuable insight on where the team should 
                      continue to direct their efforts in terms of refining our design.</p>

                    <p>
                        When comparing my learning thus far in the course with the learning outcomes in the course profile, I think this course was overall valuable. 
                        From a technical standpoint I did learn some new techniques like jQuery, PHP and caching which I found quite interesting. A times it did feel 
                        like technical concepts were being introduced a bit to rapidly and there was a focus on introducing as many concepts as possible rather than depth. 
                        For example, I felt that jQuery concepts were valuable but would have like more in instruction on the different ways we could apply it. Our project 
                        did not need PHP so this did not feel so valuable to me. One of the learning outcomes was to demonstrate practical and technical skills, which
                         I think I was able to achieve by completing the team project. More specifically, implementing the sound match game has forced me to explore 
                         some new areas of JavaScript I havenâ€™t touched before.  
                        <br><br>
                        Personally, reflecting on a weekly basis was challenging but also valuable. I found that thinking about and reflecting on a specific action 
                        in a week allowed me to appreciate the project process as a whole. However, in future I think this course could benefit from clearer instruction 
                        in terms of requirements. In the CRJ section in blackboard as well as in the course profile it states the CRJs are not required. However, during 
                        studio sessions and practical we were told they were required which was quite confusing.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, multiple learning outcomes focus on working effectively in a team and communicating design ideas via different mediums. I think this was 
                        the most successful aspect of the course for me. My team worked well together. We were all respectful and strove to help and support each other 
                        at each deliverable stage. I believe this is due to the work we put in the beginning to understanding each others working styles and our commitment 
                        to being flexible and having open communication. Our oral presentations also went well, and I felt confident in my ability to communicate my designs 
                        orally.

## Disclaimer: 
In presenting this work, We, T21 N.A.D.O team from UQ DECO7180 course, acknowledge we have not consulted the [Yugara Aboriginal] Knowledge custodians. [We were unable to connect with the Knowledge custodians and recognise the impact this may have on our treatment of the work]. The work presented is a proposal only. However, we will relinquish all proposed concepts as part of a collaborative and participatory design process for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander custodians' to self determine the design process, purpose, benefits, and outcomes.
